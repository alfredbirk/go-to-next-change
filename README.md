## Features

-   Go to next git change
    -   Mac: `opt+z`
    -   Windows: `alt+z`
-   Go to previous git change
    -   Mac: `opt+a`
    -   Windows: `alt+a`

## Other features

-   `Go to next changed file`
-   `Go to previous changed file`

## If you use Tree view

-   If you use "Tree view" in the source control (as opposed to the default List view), go to settings and check off the setting `Go to next change: Tree view`. That will make the changes cycle in correct order.
