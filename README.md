## Features

-   Go to next git change: `alt+z` / `opt+z`
-   Go to previous git change: `alt+a` / `opt+a`

## Other features

-   Revert selected changes and save file: `alt+q` / `opt+q`
-   Go to next changed file
-   Go to previous changed file

## If you use Tree view

-   If you use "Tree view" in the source control (as opposed to the default List view), go to settings and check off the setting `Go to next change: Tree view`. That will make the changes cycle in correct order.
